- **Global CLI Commands**
  - Task Master now provides a global CLI through the `task-master` command
  - All functionality from `scripts/dev.js` is available through this interface
  - Install globally with `npm install -g claude-task-master` or use locally via `npx`
  - Use `task-master <command>` instead of `node scripts/dev.js <command>`
  - Examples:
    - `task-master list` instead of `node scripts/dev.js list`
    - `task-master next` instead of `node scripts/dev.js next`
    - `task-master expand --id=3` instead of `node scripts/dev.js expand --id=3`
  - All commands accept the same options as their script equivalents
  - The CLI provides additional commands like `task-master init` for project setup

- **Development Workflow Process**
  - Start new projects by running `task-master init` or `node scripts/dev.js parse-prd --input=<prd-file.txt>` to generate initial tasks.json
  - Begin coding sessions with `task-master list` to see current tasks, status, and IDs
  - Analyze task complexity with `task-master analyze-complexity --research` before breaking down tasks
  - Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
  - Clarify tasks by checking task files in tasks/ directory or asking for user input
  - View specific task details using `task-master show <id>` to understand implementation requirements
  - Break down complex tasks using `task-master expand --id=<id>` with appropriate flags
  - Clear existing subtasks if needed using `task-master clear-subtasks --id=<id>` before regenerating
  - Implement code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
  - Verify tasks according to test strategies before marking as complete
  - Mark completed tasks with `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done`
  - Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan
  - Generate task files with `task-master generate` after updating tasks.json
  - Maintain valid dependency structure with `task-master fix-dependencies` when needed
  - Respect dependency chains and task priorities when selecting work
  - Report progress regularly using the list command
